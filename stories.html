              <p>Our personal journey into this world of autism began just over eight years ago with the birth of our son, Perry. Since the beginning, he struggled immensely. The first thing we noticed was that he seemed very restless. He was always unsettled. He had a lack of recognition in his eye. He didn’t eat. He didn’t sleep. As each day passed, we recognized more ‘red flag’ characteristics of autism with repetitive behaviors, speech/sound delays and more.</p>

              <p>Brock Ott was 2 years old when his parents, Brian and Naidona, began to notice differences between him and other kids his age. Their research seemed to point to autism, but his local pediatrician and a neurologist both dismissed the idea. It wasn’t until he was 6 years old, entering first grade, that Brock was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a group of complex developmental disabilities that cause problems with social interaction and communication.</p>

          <p>I'd always found the world a bit confusing. I never understood why people behave the way they do and why I never really seemed to fit in. I'd done well at school, but had found it difficult to relate to people and to make friends.I did well at university though and married my fantastic (and extremely patient) wife. After graduating, I got a good job that I enjoyed. But I still couldn't help feeling that I was an observer on the outside, as if there was a big secret that everybody in the world knew but me.</p>

          <p>I feel my own history means I have a special understanding of families with extra needs, which is where I’d like to specialise. I still get anxious, and I get lost when I go out, but I have a few relaxation techniques which help with the anxiety. I see my autism as a positive thing overall. It does not define who I am but is part of my make-up, I embrace it and am proud of it. I live for today, for my husband, my children and my family and would like to thank them all for being there for me.</p>
